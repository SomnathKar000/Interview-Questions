## SQL

SQL stands for Structure Query Language. It is standard programing language used for operating Relational Databases.

## RDBMS

A relational database management system (RDBMS) is a program used to create, update, and manage relational databases. Some of the most well-known RDBMSs include MySQL, PostgreSQL, MariaDB, Microsoft SQL Server, and Oracle Database.

Examples: MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, SQL Server, Microsoft SQL Server

## NoSQL

NoSQL is a non-relational database, which does not reqire a fixed schema it avoids joins and is easy to scale. The major purpose of using a NoSQL database is for distributed data.

## Non-Relational database

A non-relational database is a database that does not use the tabular schema of rows and columns found in most traditional database systems

Examples: MongoDB, Cassandra, Couchbase, Amazon DynamoDB, Redis

## The five critical differences between SQL and NoSQL are:

    - SQL databases are relational, and NoSQL databases are non-relational.
    - SQL databases use structured query language (SQL) and have a predefined schema. NoSQL databases have dynamic schemas for unstructured data.
    - SQL databases are vertically scalable, while NoSQL databases are horizontally scalable.
    - SQL databases are table-based, while NoSQL databases are document, key-value, graph, or wide-column stores.
    - SQL databases are better for multi-row transactions, while NoSQL is better for unstructured data like documents or JSON.
    - SQL follows ACID(Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) Model and NoSQL follows BASE(Basically Available, Soft State, Eventually Consistent) Model.

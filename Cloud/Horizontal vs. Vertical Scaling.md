## What Is Scalability?

`Scalability` describes a system’s elasticity. While we often use it to refer to a system’s ability to grow, it is not exclusive to this definition. We can scale down, scale up, and scale out accordingly.

If you are running a website, web service, or application, its success hinges on the amount of network traffic it receives. It is common to underestimate just how much traffic your system will incur, especially in the early stages. This could result in a crashed server and/or a decline in your service quality.

Thus, scalability describes your system’s ability to adapt to change and demand. Good scalability protects you from future downtime and ensures the quality of your service.

## What Is Horizontal Scaling?

Horizontal scaling (aka scaling out) refers to adding additional nodes or machines to your infrastructure to cope with new demands. If you are hosting an application on a server and find that it no longer has the capacity or capabilities to handle traffic, adding a server may be your solution.

## What Is Vertical Scaling?

Vertical scaling (aka scaling up) describes adding additional resources to a system so that it meets demand. How is this different from horizontal scaling?

While horizontal scaling refers to adding additional nodes, vertical scaling describes adding more power to your current machines. For instance, if your server requires more processing power, vertical scaling would mean upgrading the CPUs. You can also vertically scale the memory, storage, or network speed.

## undefined vs not defined

In JavaScript, `undefined` and "not defined" refer to different concepts related to variables and values.

1. **Undefined**:

   The value `undefined` represents a variable that has been declared but has not been assigned a value. In other words, if you declare a variable without assigning any value to it, its value will be `undefined` by default.

   ```javascript
   let x;
   console.log(x); // Output: undefined
   ```

   If you access an object property or an array element that does not exist, the result will also be `undefined`.

   ```javascript
   const obj = { name: "John" };
   console.log(obj.age); // Output: undefined

   const arr = [1, 2, 3];
   console.log(arr[10]); // Output: undefined
   ```

   Additionally, when a function does not have a `return` statement or when a variable does not have an assigned value within a function, the returned value will be `undefined`.

2. **Not Defined**:

   "Not defined" refers to a situation where you are trying to access a variable or identifier that has not been declared at all. This results in a ReferenceError, indicating that the variable is not recognized in the current scope.

   ```javascript
   console.log(y); // ReferenceError: y is not defined
   ```

   In this case, `y` has not been declared or defined anywhere in the code, so trying to access it results in an error.

In summary:

- `undefined` is a special value in JavaScript that indicates a variable has been declared but not assigned a value, or that an object property or array element does not exist.
- "Not defined" refers to a variable or identifier that has not been declared at all in the current scope, resulting in a ReferenceError when accessed.

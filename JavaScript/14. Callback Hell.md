## Two issues while using callbacks

1. **Callback Hell (Pyramid of Doom):**
   When a function is passed as an argument to another function, it becomes a callback function. This process continues and there are many callbacks inside another's Callback function.
   This grows the code horizontally instead of vertically. That mechanism is known as callback hell.

Example of Callback Hell:

```javascript
doSomething((result1) => {
  doSomethingElse(result1, (result2) => {
    doYetAnotherThing(result2, (result3) => {
      // More nested callbacks...
    });
  });
});
```

2. **Inversion of Control:**
   The callback function is passed to another callback, this way we lose the control of our code. We don't know what is happening behind the scene and the program becomes very difficult to maintain.
   That process is called inversion of control

Example of Inversion of Control:

```javascript
function fetchData(callback) {
  setTimeout(() => {
    callback("Data retrieved");
  }, 1000);
}

fetchData((result) => {
  console.log(result);
});
```

## async

`async` is basically a keyword that is used with function to create a async function

## await

`await` is a keyword that can only be used inside a async function and you write this `await` keyword in front of a promise an it will resolve the promise.

Here's an example:

```javascript
async function fetchData() {
  try {
    // Asynchronously fetch some data
    const response = await fetch("https://api.github.com/users/SomnathKar000");
    const data = await response.json();

    // Now you can work with the fetched data as if it's synchronous
    console.log(data);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Error:", error);
  }
}

// Call the async function
fetchData();
```

**Async/await** is a feature in JavaScript that simplifies working with asynchronous code, making it look more like synchronous code. It's built on top of promises and provides a more straightforward way to work with asynchronous operations.

## How async and await works under the hood

**Await Keyword**: Inside an async function, you can use the `await` keyword before a Promise. When JavaScript encounters an `await` statement, it doesn't block the entire call stack. Instead, it does the following:

- It pauses the execution of the current function.
- It waits for the Promise to resolve. While waiting, the function is effectively suspended, and JavaScript can continue executing other code in the meantime (non-blocking).
- When the Promise resolves, the function resumes from where it left off, with the resolved value of the Promise (or rejection if it's rejected).

Now, let's update your example to explain the execution flow more clearly:

```javascript
let pr1 = new Promise((resolve, reject) =>
  setTimeout(() => resolve("Promise 1 is done"), 1000)
);
let pr2 = new Promise((resolve, reject) =>
  setTimeout(() => resolve("Promise 2 is done"), 2000)
);
let pr3 = new Promise((resolve, reject) =>
  setTimeout(() => resolve("Promise 3 is done"), 3000)
);

const getPromise1 = async () => {
  console.log("getPromise1 is executed");
  const pr1Data = await pr1; // Execution pauses here
  console.log(pr1Data); // This runs when pr1 is resolved
  const pr3data = await pr3; // Execution pauses again
  console.log(pr3data); // This runs when pr3 is resolved
};

const getPromise2 = async () => {
  console.log("getPromise2 is executed");
  const pr2Data = await pr2; // Execution pauses here
  console.log(pr2Data); // This runs when pr2 is resolved
};

getPromise1(); // Starts execution of getPromise1
getPromise2(); // Starts execution of getPromise2
```

Output:

```
getPromise1 is executed
getPromise2 is executed
Promise 1 is done
Promise 2 is done
Promise 3 is done
```

As you can see, async and await don't block the entire call stack. They allow you to write asynchronous code that looks sequential and is easier to reason about. The execution is paused and resumed based on the resolution of Promises, allowing other code to run in the meantime.

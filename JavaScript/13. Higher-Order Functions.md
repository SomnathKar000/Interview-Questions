## Higher-Order Functions

**Higher-Order Functions**: Higher-order functions are a fundamental concept in JavaScript and functional programming. A higher-order function is a function that takes one or more functions as arguments or returns a function as its result. Essentially, it operates on functions, either by taking them as arguments or by returning them.

Here are some common higher-order functions in JavaScript:

1. **`map`**: The `map` function is used to transform each element of an array using a provided function and returns a new array with the transformed elements. It takes a function as an argument and applies that function to each element in the array.

   ```javascript
   const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
   const doubled = numbers.map((number) => number * 2);
   // doubled: [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
   ```

2. **`filter`**: The `filter` function is used to create a new array with all elements that pass a provided test. It takes a function that returns `true` or `false` and returns a new array containing only the elements for which the function returns `true`.

   ```javascript
   const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
   const evenNumbers = numbers.filter((number) => number % 2 === 0);
   // evenNumbers: [2, 4]
   ```

3. **`reduce`**: The `reduce` function is used to reduce an array to a single value by applying a function to each element of the array, accumulating the results. It takes a function and an initial value as arguments.

   ```javascript
   const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
   const sum = numbers.reduce(
     (accumulator, currentValue) => accumulator + currentValue,
     0
   );
   // sum: 15
   ```

4. **`forEach`**: The `forEach` function is used to iterate over an array and perform a specified operation on each element. It takes a function as an argument.

   ```javascript
   const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
   numbers.forEach((number) => console.log(number));
   // Output: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
   ```

5. **`sort`**: The `sort` function is used to sort the elements of an array in place and returns the sorted array. It can take a compare function as an argument to determine the sorting order.

   ```javascript
   const fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry", "date"];
   const sortedFruits = fruits.sort((a, b) => a.localeCompare(b));
   // sortedFruits: ["apple", "banana", "cherry", "date"]
   ```

6. **`find`**: The `find` function is used to find the first element in an array that satisfies a provided test function. It returns the first element that matches the condition.

   ```javascript
   const users = [
     { name: "Alice", age: 25 },
     { name: "Bob", age: 30 },
     { name: "Charlie", age: 35 },
   ];
   const user = users.find((user) => user.age === 30);
   // user: { name: "Bob", age: 30 }
   ```

## Higher-Order Functions & First-Class Functions

**First-Class Functions:**

First-class functions are a concept in programming languages where functions are treated as first-class citizens. This means that functions can be:

1. **Assigned to Variables:** You can assign a function to a variable.

   ```javascript
   const greet = function (name) {
     return `Hello, ${name}!`;
   };
   ```

2. **Passed as Arguments:** You can pass a function as an argument to another function.

   ```javascript
   function execute(func, argument) {
     return func(argument);
   }
   ```

3. **Returned from Functions:** A function can return another function.

   ```javascript
   function multiplier(factor) {
     return function (x) {
       return x * factor;
     };
   }
   ```

**Higher-Order Functions:**

Higher-order functions, on the other hand, are functions that operate on other functions. They can take functions as arguments, return functions, or both.

1. **Taking Functions as Arguments:**

   ```javascript
   function apply(func, argument) {
     return func(argument);
   }

   const square = (x) => x * x;
   const result = apply(square, 5); // Result is 25
   ```

2. **Returning Functions:**

   ```javascript
   function multiplier(factor) {
     return function (x) {
       return x * factor;
     };
   }

   const double = multiplier(2);
   const result = double(5); // Result is 10
   ```

**Differences:**

1. **Role:**

   - First-Class Functions: This concept relates to how functions are treated in a language.
   - Higher-Order Functions: This concept relates to functions that operate on other functions.

2. **Usage:**

   - First-Class Functions: It's a language feature that allows functions to be treated as values.
   - Higher-Order Functions: It's a design pattern or concept where functions take other functions as arguments or return them.

3. **Examples:**
   - First-Class Functions: Assigning a function to a variable, passing a function as an argument, or returning a function.
   - Higher-Order Functions: Functions like `map`, `filter`, `reduce`, etc., that take other functions as arguments.

**Common Ground:**

Both first-class functions and higher-order functions are closely related and often used together in functional programming. They share common ground in that they both deal with functions as values and enable more expressive and flexible programming.

**Common Ground Examples:**

1. **Passing Functions as Arguments:**

   ```javascript
   function operateOnNumbers(operation, a, b) {
     return operation(a, b);
   }

   function add(x, y) {
     return x + y;
   }

   const result = operateOnNumbers(add, 2, 3); // Result is 5
   ```

2. **Returning Functions:**

   ```javascript
   function createMultiplier(factor) {
     return function (x) {
       return x * factor;
     };
   }

   const double = createMultiplier(2);
   const result = double(5); // Result is 10
   ```

In both examples, functions are treated as first-class citizens (can be passed as arguments and returned), and higher-order functions are used to operate on functions.

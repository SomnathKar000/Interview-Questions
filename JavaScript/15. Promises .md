## Promises

Promises are objects used to manage asynchronous operations in JavaScript. They serve as placeholders to store the eventual result (or error) of an asynchronous task.

Promises have three states:

1. **Pending**: The initial state, representing an ongoing asynchronous operation.
2. **Fulfilled**: The state when the asynchronous operation is successfully completed, and a value is available.
3. **Rejected**: The state when an error occurs during the asynchronous operation.

Promises provide a structured way to handle asynchronous code and avoid issues like callback hell. Developers can attach functions to promise objects using `.then()` and `.catch()` to handle the results or errors when the operation is complete. This approach improves code readability and reliability.

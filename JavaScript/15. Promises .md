## Promises

Promises are objects used to manage asynchronous operations in JavaScript. They serve as placeholders to store the eventual result (or error) of an asynchronous task.

Promises have three states:

1. **Pending**: The initial state, representing an ongoing asynchronous operation.
2. **Fulfilled**: The state when the asynchronous operation is successfully completed, and a value is available.
3. **Rejected**: The state when an error occurs during the asynchronous operation.

Promises provide a structured way to handle asynchronous code and avoid issues like callback hell. Developers can attach functions to promise objects using `.then()` and `.catch()` to handle the results or errors when the operation is complete. This approach improves code readability and reliability.

## Create a Promise

To create a Promise in JavaScript, you can use the Promise constructor. A Promise is typically used for handling asynchronous operations. Here's how you can create a simple Promise:

```javascript
const myPromise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  // Asynchronous operation, e.g., fetching data from a server
  setTimeout(() => {
    const success = true; // Simulate a successful operation
    if (success) {
      resolve("Operation succeeded"); // Resolve the Promise with a value
    } else {
      reject("Operation failed"); // Reject the Promise with an error
    }
  }, 2000); // Simulate a 2-second delay
});

// You can attach callback functions to handle the resolution or rejection of the Promise
myPromise
  .then((result) => {
    console.log("Success:", result); // This will be executed if the Promise is resolved
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    console.error("Error:", error); // This will be executed if the Promise is rejected
  });
```

## How NodeJS Works

When a client makes a request to a Node.js server, that request is placed into the Event Queue. The Event Loop periodically checks the Event Queue for pending requests, processing them in a first-in-first-out (FIFO) manner. Think of the Event Loop as a gatekeeper monitoring the Event Queue's status.

Requests can be of two types: Blocking Operations (Synchronous) or Non-Blocking Operations (Asynchronous).

If the request is a Non-Blocking Operation, the Event Loop processes the request and sends the data back to the user without delay.

However, if the request is a Blocking Operation, it is directed to the Thread Pool. The Thread Pool is a resource containing a limited number of threads or workers responsible for handling Blocking Operations. The Thread Pool checks if there are available workers to execute the Blocking Operation. If a worker is available, it is assigned to handle the task. Once the Blocking Operation is completed, the worker returns to the Thread Pool and becomes available for other tasks.

Here are examples of both blocking (synchronous) and non-blocking (asynchronous) operations in Node.js:

**Blocking (Synchronous) Operation Example:**

```javascript
const fs = require("fs");

// Synchronous file read
try {
  const data = fs.readFileSync("file.txt", "utf-8");
  console.log("Synchronous Read:", data);
} catch (error) {
  console.error("Error:", error);
}

console.log("After Synchronous Read");
```

In this example, `fs.readFileSync` performs a synchronous read operation. The code waits until the file read is completed before moving to the next statement. If the file operation takes a long time, it can block the event loop.

**Non-blocking (Asynchronous) Operation Example:**

```javascript
const fs = require("fs");

// Asynchronous file read
fs.readFile("file.txt", "utf-8", (error, data) => {
  if (error) {
    console.error("Error:", error);
    return;
  }
  console.log("Asynchronous Read:", data);
});

console.log("After Asynchronous Read");
```

In this example, `fs.readFile` performs an asynchronous read operation. The code continues executing without waiting for the file read to complete. When the read operation is finished, the provided callback function is called.

The key difference is that in the non-blocking example, the program doesn't wait for the file operation to finish, allowing it to handle other tasks in the meantime, making it more efficient for handling multiple concurrent requests in a server environment.
